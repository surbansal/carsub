In order to run the integration tests, the following dependencies need to be installed:

* Python
* Selenium (pip install -U selenium)
* Chrome webdriver (https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver_installer/)


The tests can be run individually

```
python browse_car_page.py
```

Or the tests can be run as a suite.  In order to add test cases to the suite, all new files will have to be added to csa_suite.py

```
python csa_suite.py
```
